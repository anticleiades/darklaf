 * Darklaf_JNFExceptions handle bridging exceptions between Foundation and Java. NSExceptions are
 * caught by the Darklaf_JNF_COCOA_ENTER()/Darklaf_JNF_COCOA_EXIT() macros, and transformed and thrown as
 * Java exceptions at the JNI boundry. The macros in Darklaf_JNFJNI.h also check for Java exceptions
 * and rethrow them as NSExceptions until they hit an @try/@catch block, or the
 * Darklaf_JNF_COCOA_ENTER()/Darklaf_JNF_COCOA_EXIT() macros.
